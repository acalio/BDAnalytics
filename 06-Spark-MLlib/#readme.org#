#+title: Machine Learning with Spark: MLlib

#+options: h:2 num:nil toc:nil

* Introduction
MLlib is the Spark is the primary library for addressing machine learning problem within the Spark ecosystem.

MLlib provides the following features:
- A collection of ML Algorithms for solving a variety of ML problem, such as classification, regression,
  clustering and collaborative filtering
- A collection of techniques for featurization, i.e., extracting and transforming the features of your dataset
- The ability to design e construct Pipeline of execution
- Persistence: models can be saved on file so that you will not be required to train a model every time you need to
  use it 
- Utility tools, mostly for linear algebra e statistics

Spark MLlib is available in the version 3.0. It now uses dataset instead 
of regular RDDs.

In the following we will discuss some of the main tools provided by MLlib. 

* Basic Statistics

** Correlation 
Correlation measures the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. 
More specifically, given two variables X e Y, they are considered:
+ positively correlated -- if when X increases Y increases and vice versa
+ negatively correlated -- if when X increases Y increases and vice versa
+ no correlated -- when their trends are not dependent from one another

The quantity compute by MLLlib is the Pearson's coefficient, which is defined in [-1,1].
A coefficient equal to 1 (-1) defines a /strong/ positive (negative) correlation. 

The following snippet compute the correlation matrix between each pair of variables.
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.{Matrix, Vectors}
import org.apache.spark.ml.stat.Correlation
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row

val data = Seq(
  Vectors.sparse(4, Seq((0, 1.0), (3, -2.0))),
  Vectors.dense(4.0, 5.0, 0.0, 3.0),
  Vectors.dense(6.0, 7.0, 0.0, 8.0),
  Vectors.sparse(4, Seq((0, 9.0), (3, 1.0)))
)

val df = data.map(Tuple1.apply).toDF("features")
val Row(coeff1: Matrix) = Correlation.corr(df, "features").head
println(s"Pearson correlation matrix:\n $coeff1")

val Row(coeff2: Matrix) = Correlation.corr(df, "features", "spearman").head
println(s"Spearman correlation matrix:\n $coeff2")
#+END_SRC

** Summarizer
It provides a summary of the main statistics for each column of a given /DataFrame/. The metrics computed
by this object are the column-wise:
+ max
+ min
+ average
+ sum
+ variance/std
+ number of non-zero elements
+ total count 


#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.{Vector, Vectors}
import org.apache.spark.ml.stat.Summarizer

val data = Seq(
  (Vectors.dense(2.0, 3.0, 5.0), 1.0),
  (Vectors.dense(4.0, 6.0, 7.0), 2.0)
)

val df = data.toDF("features", "weight")

val (meanVal, varianceVal) = df.select(metrics("mean", "variance")
  .summary($"features", $"weight").as("summary"))
  .select("summary.mean", "summary.variance")
  .as[(Vector, Vector)].first()

println(s"with weight: mean = ${meanVal}, variance = ${varianceVal}")

val (meanVal2, varianceVal2) = df.select(mean($"features"), variance($"features"))
  .as[(Vector, Vector)].first()

println(s"without weight: mean = ${meanVal2}, sum = ${varianceVal2}")
#+END_SRC


* Data Sources
MLlib is able to  work with a variety of "standard" formats as Parquet, CSV, JSON. In addition to that the 
library provides mechanisms to read some other special data format.

** Image data source
This data is used to load image files directly from a folder. Images can be in any format (e.g., jpg, png, ...).
When you load the DataFrame, it has a column of type StryctType, which represents the actual image.
Each image has an image schema which comprises the following information:
- origin: StringType, the path of the file containing the image
- height: IntegerType, the height of the image
- width: IntegerType, the width of the image
- nChannels: Integertype, number of image channels
- mode: IntegerType, OpenCV compatible type
- data: BinaryType, the image bytes in OpenCV-compatible format

In order to read the images you need to use the "image" format. You also need to provide the path of the folder
containing the images you want to read.
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
 val df = spark.read.format("image").option("dropInvalid", true).load("{your path}")
#+END_SRC

** LIBSVM data source
This source is used to read data in the libsvm format from a given directory. 
When you load the file, MLlib creates a data frame with two columns:
+ label: DoubleType, represents the labels of the dataset
+ features: VectorUDT, represents the feature-vectors of each data point

In order to read this type of data you need to specify the "libsvm" format. 
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
 val df = spark.read.format("libsvm").option("numFeatures", "780").load("{your path}")
#+END_SRC



* Pipelines
Pipelines are a very convenient to define e organize all the single procedures and step that contribute to you entire
machine learning approach.

They are very similar to /scikit-learn/ pipelines. The Pipelines API are designed around the following concepts:

- DataFrame
- Transformer. It is an abstraction that includes both feature transformers and ML models. 
  Any transformer has a method =transform()= which takes a DataFrame as input and returns another DataFrame 
  obtained by applying some function, whose results are retrieved within a new column appended to the original structure.
- Estimators. It is an abstraction for denoting any algorithm that has the method =fit=  in its own interface. 
  The =fit()= method takes as input a =DataFrame=  and returns an object of type =Model=. 
- Pipelines. Usually, when you deal with ML problems, the entire algorithm representing your approach for solving the problem
  can be narrowed down to a set of subsequent different steps.


** How Pipelines Work
Let's imagine you are dealing with some 
classification problems over text documents. 

Chances are that your workflow will include the following stages: 
  1. Split each document into words
  2. Convert each word int a vector -- you may want to apply some representation model such as Word2Vec
  3. Train and compute the prediction of your model

Step 1 requires  a Transformer, while Step 2 and Step 3 require to use some Estimators. Through a Pipeline you 
will be able to aggregate all these steps and to represent them as a pipeline.

A Pipeline is specified as a sequence of stages, and each stage is either a Transformer or an Estimator.
 These stages are run in order, and the input DataFrame is transformed as it passes through each stage.

 For Transformer stages, the transform() method is called on the DataFrame.
 For Estimator stages, the fit() method is called to produce a Transformer 
(which becomes part of the PipelineModel, or fitted Pipeline), 
and that Transformerâ€™s transform() method is called on the DataFrame.

We illustrate this for the simple text document workflow. The figure below is for the training time usage of a Pipeline.
  
The following image represents the pipeline described above.

#+caption: Pipeline
#+name: fig:label
[[./img/pip.png]]


A Pipeline works as an Estimator, it means that it has the method =fit()=. When you call this method
on the pipeline, all the stages are executed. More specifically, for any stage S_i we have:
- if S_i is a transformer, the pipeline will call the method transform.
- if S_i is an estimator, the pipeline will first call the =fit= method and then the =transform= method

The method =fit= called on a Pipeline yields a Pipeline model, which is also a Transformer. This means that you can
use the this model to call the =transform= method. As a result, the pipeline will go through all the stages by calling
the =transform= method over each on of them. Be careful that, as opposed to when you called the =fit= method 
over the entire pipeline, when you call =transform= on the Pipeline, all the estimators work as Transformers.


** Parameters
You can specify the parameters for either a Transformer of an Estimators in one of the following
two ways:
1. Both Estimators and Transformers share a common API to specify their parameters. 
   A parameter is specified via a =Param= object, which is a named parameter with a self-contained documentation.
   A =ParamMap= is instead a set of parameter-value pairs. You can define a =ParamMap= and pass it to the 
   =fit()= or the =transform()= method. A =ParamMap= is created with the following notation:
 #+BEGIN_SRC scala
 ParamMap(l1.maxIter -> 10, l2.maxIter -> 20)
 #+END_SRC
   Where l1 and l2 are two instance included in the Pipeline.

2. Set the parameter directly on the instance that you include within the your Pipeline. Let =algo= be an instance
   of any ML algorithm available in MLlib. You can use this instance to set directly the parameters for that particular algoirthm
   Usually, you have method like =set{NameOfTheParameter}=.

* Extracting, transforming and Selecting 
This section is organized into three different subsections:
1. Feature Extractors. This section introduces some algorithm for extracting features from your dataset
2. Feature Transformers. This section introduces some of the algorithm that execute commonly used transformations 
   the input dataset

   
** Feature Extractors

*** Word2Vec
Word2Vec is an Estimator which takes as input a sequence of words representing a document and then
it trains a Word2VecModel over these words. The model maps each word to a unique fixed-size vector. 
A document is then represented by simply taking the average of all the vectors associated with any word
contained within the original text. 
Once you have a vector, you can apply all sorts of ML algorithms.

The following snippet shows how to use this model.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.Word2Vec
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vector
import org.apache.spark.sql.Row

// Input data: Each row is a bag of words from a sentence or document.
val documentDF = spark.createDataFrame(Seq(
  "Hi I heard about Spark".split(" "),
  "I wish Java could use case classes".split(" "),
  "Logistic regression models are neat".split(" ")
).map(Tuple1.apply)).toDF("text")

// Learn a mapping from words to Vectors.
val word2Vec = new Word2Vec()
  .setInputCol("text")
  .setOutputCol("result")
  .setVectorSize(3)
  .setMinCount(0)
val model = word2Vec.fit(documentDF)

val result = model.transform(documentDF)
result.collect().foreach { case Row(text: Seq[_], features: Vector) =>
  println(s"Text: [${text.mkString(", ")}] => \nVector: $features\n") }
#+END_SRC

** Feature Transformers
*** Binarizer 
Binarization is the process of thresholding numerical features to binary (0/1) features.

Binarizer takes the common parameters inputCol and outputCol, as 
well as the threshold for binarization. Feature values greater than the threshold
 are binarized to 1.0; values equal to or less
 than the threshold are binarized to 0.0. 
Both Vector and Double types are supported for inputCol.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.Binarizer

val data = Array((0, 0.1), (1, 0.8), (2, 0.2))
val dataFrame = spark.createDataFrame(data).toDF("id", "feature")

val binarizer: Binarizer = new Binarizer()
  .setInputCol("feature")
  .setOutputCol("binarized_feature")
  .setThreshold(0.5)

val binarizedDataFrame = binarizer.transform(dataFrame)

println(s"Binarizer output with Threshold = ${binarizer.getThreshold}")
binarizedDataFrame.show()
#+END_SRC

*** PCA

PCA is a statistical procedure that uses
 an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated
 variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables
 called principal components. A PCA class trains a model to project
 vectors to a low-dimensional space using PCA. The example below shows how to
 project 5-dimensional feature vectors into 3-dimensional principal components.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.PCA
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vectors

val data = Array(
  Vectors.sparse(5, Seq((1, 1.0), (3, 7.0))),
  Vectors.dense(2.0, 0.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0),
  Vectors.dense(4.0, 0.0, 0.0, 6.0, 7.0)
)
val df = spark.createDataFrame(data.map(Tuple1.apply)).toDF("features")

val pca = new PCA()
  .setInputCol("features")
  .setOutputCol("pcaFeatures")
  .setK(3)
  .fit(df)

val result = pca.transform(df).select("pcaFeatures")
result.show(false)
#+END_SRC


*** OneHotEncoder
One-hot-encoding maps a categorical feature to a binary vector with at most a single one-value.
For instance, imagine you have a categorical feature that allows 5 possible categorical values: 
A,B,C,D,E. This feature is then represented as a 5-sized vector where each value is mapped to 
a particular position. Therefore the value A - becomes -> [1,0,0,0,0], the value B - becomes -> [0,1,0,0,0]
ans so on.

The following snippet shows how to use this transformer:
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.OneHotEncoder

val df = spark.createDataFrame(Seq(
  (0.0, 1.0),
  (1.0, 0.0),
  (2.0, 1.0),
  (0.0, 2.0),
  (0.0, 1.0),
  (2.0, 0.0)
)).toDF("categoryIndex1", "categoryIndex2")

val encoder = new OneHotEncoder()
  .setInputCols(Array("categoryIndex1", "categoryIndex2"))
  .setOutputCols(Array("categoryVec1", "categoryVec2"))
val model = encoder.fit(df)

val encoded = model.transform(df)
encoded.show()
#+END_SRC


** StandardScaler
Many ML algorithm are very sensitive to the scale of the input dataset. These algorithms work best when 
all the feature have the same scale. For this reason it is often required to normalize your data.
This scaler normalize  the data so that each numerical feature has unit standard deviation and zero mean.

The StandardScaler is actually an Estimator, thus it has the method =fit= which returns a =StandardScalerModel=
object, which is a Transformer. Therefore, by calling =transform= on the StandardScaler model you can scale
the input features as desired. 

The following snippet shows how to use this scaler.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.StandardScaler

val dataFrame = spark.read.format("libsvm").load("data/mllib/sample_libsvm_data.txt")

val scaler = new StandardScaler()
  .setInputCol("features")
  .setOutputCol("scaledFeatures")
  .setWithStd(true)
  .setWithMean(false)

// Compute summary statistics by fitting the StandardScaler.
val scalerModel = scaler.fit(dataFrame)

// Normalize each feature to have unit standard deviation.
val scaledData = scalerModel.transform(dataFrame)
scaledData.show()


#+END_SRC

This is not the only option when it comes to scaling your data.
 There are other techniques that work the same way as this scaler, the only 
thing that change of course is the algorithm used for scale the data.

** Bucketizer 
A Bucketizer transforms a real-valued feature into a column where values are divided into buckets.

When you use this type of transformer you need to specify the buckets into which you wish to divided your
feature. Therefore you must specify an ordered vector containing the ranges according to which buckets
have to been defined.
 
The following snippet shows how to use this transformer.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.Bucketizer

val splits = Array(Double.NegativeInfinity, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, Double.PositiveInfinity)

val data = Array(-999.9, -0.5, -0.3, 0.0, 0.2, 999.9)
val dataFrame = spark.createDataFrame(data.map(Tuple1.apply)).toDF("features")

val bucketizer = new Bucketizer()
  .setInputCol("features")
  .setOutputCol("bucketedFeatures")
  .setSplits(splits)

// Transform original data into its bucket index.
val bucketedData = bucketizer.transform(dataFrame)

println(s"Bucketizer output with ${bucketizer.getSplits.length-1} buckets")
bucketedData.show()

val splitsArray = Array(
  Array(Double.NegativeInfinity, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, Double.PositiveInfinity),
  Array(Double.NegativeInfinity, -0.3, 0.0, 0.3, Double.PositiveInfinity))

val data2 = Array(
  (-999.9, -999.9),
  (-0.5, -0.2),
  (-0.3, -0.1),
  (0.0, 0.0),
  (0.2, 0.4),
  (999.9, 999.9))
val dataFrame2 = spark.createDataFrame(data2).toDF("features1", "features2")

val bucketizer2 = new Bucketizer()
  .setInputCols(Array("features1", "features2"))
  .setOutputCols(Array("bucketedFeatures1", "bucketedFeatures2"))
  .setSplitsArray(splitsArray)

// Transform original data into its bucket index.
val bucketedData2 = bucketizer2.transform(dataFrame2)

println(s"Bucketizer output with [" +
  s"${bucketizer2.getSplitsArray(0).length-1}, " +
  s"${bucketizer2.getSplitsArray(1).length-1}] buckets for each input column")
bucketedData2.show()
#+END_SRC



** Imputer
The Imputer is an estimator that is useful for replacing missing/null/NaN values accordingly
to a predefined strategy. For instance, you might use an Imputer to replace the missing values
in a feature of the dataset by replacing them with the average value computed with respect
to that feature. 
An Imputer can only work with numerical features -- it is not able to understand 
categorical values. It also provides the ability to configure which value has to be considered
as  "missing". For instance, if we set =.setMissingValue(0)= then all the occurrences of 0
will be replaced by the Imputer.

The following snippet shows how to use the Imputer.
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.Imputer

val df = spark.createDataFrame(Seq(
  (1.0, Double.NaN),
  (2.0, Double.NaN),
  (Double.NaN, 3.0),
  (4.0, 4.0),
  (5.0, 5.0)
)).toDF("a", "b")

val imputer = new Imputer()
  .setInputCols(Array("a", "b"))
  .setOutputCols(Array("out_a", "out_b"))

val model = imputer.fit(df)
model.transform(df).show()
#+END_SRC

** COMMENT Feature Selectors: VectorSlicer
The VectorSlicer is a transformer that takes a feature vector and outputs 
a new feature vector with a sub-array of the original features. 

The following snippet shows how to use this transformer.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import java.util.Arrays

import org.apache.spark.ml.attribute.{Attribute, AttributeGroup, NumericAttribute}
import org.apache.spark.ml.feature.VectorSlicer
import org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vectors
import org.apache.spark.sql.{Row, SparkSession}
import org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType

val data = Arrays.asList(
  Row(Vectors.sparse(3, Seq((0, -2.0), (1, 2.3)))),
  Row(Vectors.dense(-2.0, 2.3, 0.0))
)

val defaultAttr = NumericAttribute.defaultAttr
val attrs = Array("f1", "f2", "f3").map(defaultAttr.withName)
val attrGroup = new AttributeGroup("userFeatures", attrs.asInstanceOf[Array[Attribute]])

val dataset = spark.createDataFrame(data, StructType(Array(attrGroup.toStructField())))

val slicer = new VectorSlicer().setInputCol("userFeatures").setOutputCol("features")

slicer.setIndices(Array(1)).setNames(Array("f3"))
// or slicer.setIndices(Array(1, 2)), or slicer.setNames(Array("f2", "f3"))

val output = slicer.transform(dataset)
output.show(false)
#+END_SRC

In order to select the features you can provide either the position of the 
features you wish to extract or the names of the features.


* Classification & Regression 
These are two different types of supervised learning problem. 

In any supervised learning problem you are provided with a set of items, each item
has a set of features, and more importantly it is assigned with a label.

The type of the label tells you if you are dealing with a regression problem rather
than a classification one. More specifically, if the label is a real value then you have
a regression problem, while if it is a categorical value then you are dealing with 
a classification problem.

MLlib offers a lot of algorithms for addressing these kinds of supervised problems.
This is the list of algorithms provided by the library:



    - Classification
        - Logistic regression
            - Binomial logistic regression
            - Multinomial logistic regression
        - Decision tree classifier
        - Random forest classifier
        - Gradient-boosted tree classifier
        - Multilayer perceptron classifier
        - Linear Support Vector Machine
        - One-vs-Rest classifier (a.k.a. One-vs-All)
        - Naive Bayes
        - Factorization machines classifier
    - Regression
        - Linear regression
        - Generalized linear regression
            - Available families
        - Decision tree regression
        - Random forest regression
        - Gradient-boosted tree regression
        - Survival regression
        - Isotonic regression
        - Factorization machines regressor
    - Linear methods
    - Factorization Machines
    - Decision trees
        - Inputs and Outputs
            - Input Columns
            - Output Columns
    - Tree Ensembles
        - Random Forests
            - Inputs and Outputs
                - Input Columns
                - Output Columns (Predictions)
        - Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBTs)
            - Inputs and Outputs
                - Input Columns
                - Output Columns (Predictions)

We will not discuss any of the previous algorithms. Since this is beyond the scope
of this lesson. A useful resource to learn (quickly) is the scikit-learn documentation,
available [[https://scikit-learn.org/][here]].

* Model Selection and Tuning

This section describes how to use MLlibâ€™s tooling 
for tuning ML algorithms and Pipelines. Built-in Cross-Validation 
and other tooling allow users to 
optimize hyperparameters in algorithms and Pipelines.

** Parameter Tuning
Parameter Tuning is the task of trying different configuration in order to 
improve performance. 

You can tune a single estimator as well as an entire pipeline. 
When you want to improve the performance of your model you need an object 
of type Evaluator. An Evaluator allows you to evaluate how well your model is able to 
fit the data. There is a number of different evaluators, the right one depends on the 
type of problem you are dealing with. For instance if you are dealing with a regression problem 
you should use the RegressionEvaluator, while for classification problems you should use
the BinaryClassificationEvaluator or the MulticlassificationEvaluator.

A common way tune an ML model is by defining a grid, which determines the range of values
a particular parameter can assume. This kind of behavior is achieved via the 
ParamGridBuilder object. A grid based tuning works as follows. Imagine 
your model M has depends on two different hyperparameters: p_1 and p_2. You define a 
range of values for each one of them. For instance you may specify that p_1 varies within 
the range [0,10] with step 2, while p_2 varies within the range [-10, 10] with step.
This means that you would have 5 different possible configuration for p_1 and 3 different
configuration for p_2. In this case your model will be trained 5x3=15 different times, assessing
every possible configuration with respect to both parameters.


** Cross Validation
Another important technique for selecting the best model is the Cross-Validation.
In order to train your model with the cross-validation there is an object 
called =CrossValidator=. 
A =CrossValidator= is actually an Estimator, so you can call =fit= and then you get 
a model. 
The following snippet shows how to use the a CrossValidator.
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
...
val tokenizer = new Tokenizer()
  .setInputCol("text")
  .setOutputCol("words")
val hashingTF = new HashingTF()
  .setInputCol(tokenizer.getOutputCol)
  .setOutputCol("features")
val lr = new LogisticRegression()
  .setMaxIter(10)
val pipeline = new Pipeline()
  .setStages(Array(tokenizer, hashingTF, lr))

// We use a ParamGridBuilder to construct a grid of parameters to search over.
// With 3 values for hashingTF.numFeatures and 2 values for lr.regParam,
// this grid will have 3 x 2 = 6 parameter settings for CrossValidator to choose from.
val paramGrid = new ParamGridBuilder()
  .addGrid(hashingTF.numFeatures, Array(10, 100, 1000))
  .addGrid(lr.regParam, Array(0.1, 0.01))
  .build()

val cv = new CrossValidator()
  .setEstimator(pipeline)
  .setEvaluator(new BinaryClassificationEvaluator)
  .setEstimatorParamMaps(paramGrid)
  .setNumFolds(2)  // Use 3+ in practice
  .setParallelism(2)  // Evaluate up to 2 parameter settings in parallel

val model = cv.fit(data)
#+END_SRC



* Anatomy of a ML application
Any ML application should adopt the following development steps:

- Think about the problem you are interested in. You should ask yourself the following 
  questions:
  - How would I frame it? 
  - Is it a supervised problem? Is it better to address the problem as a 
    classification problem rather then a regression one? 
- Get the data. In this stage you get the data required to solve the problem you 
  are interested in.
- Analyze your data, compute summary statistics, plot the data, gain insights.
- Prepare your data to apply ML algorithms. In this stage you apply transformer to clean 
  your data -- for instance you can apply the Imputer to replace missing value --, or
  you can apply transformer to obtain a different representation of your data -- for 
  instance Word2Vec or OneHotEncoding.
- Split your dataset. You **must** always remember to reserve a fraction of your data 
  to validate your model. It means that you must split the data (at least) into training and test 
  set. The training set is used to train your model, while the test is used to understand how godd
  is your model in terms of generalization
- Select the most promising models and apply parameter tuning on them
- Present the results
